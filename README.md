# VR-Assignment
A VR app for mindfulllness

Virtual Reality (VR) and meditation make a powerful combination that can enhance the meditation experience by providing a more immersive, controlled, and focused environment.

1. An Immersive, Distraction-Free Environment:
Escape from the Outside World: One of the biggest challenges for many people when meditating is finding a quiet, peaceful environment free from distractions. With VR, you can be transported to serene, calming environments â€” a forest in our case.
2. Deep Focus:
The immersive nature of VR helps shut out external stimuli (like sounds, notifications, and other distractions), helping you focus completely on your meditation practice.
